# Spring Boot Learning Repository

Welcome to my **Spring Boot Learning Repository**! This repository serves as a collection of code and projects that I have created while learning Spring Boot, a popular framework for building Java-based enterprise applications.

## üöÄ Purpose

The main goal of this repository is to track my journey as I learn and practice Spring Boot concepts. It includes various projects and code snippets that demonstrate my understanding of the framework, such as building REST APIs, connecting to databases, security configurations, and more.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Spring Boot**
- **Spring Data JPA**
- **Spring Security**
- **H2 Database / MySQL / PostgreSQL** (depending on the project)
- **JUnit** / **Mockito** (for testing)
- **Maven** / **Gradle** (for dependency management)

## üìÇ Repository Structure

- **/src**: Contains all the source code for various Spring Boot projects.
- **/docs**: Documentation for certain projects (if applicable).
- **/tests**: Contains test files for unit and integration tests.

## üìò Projects

Each project is a separate directory within this repository, and each one focuses on a different aspect of Spring Boot. Some examples include:

- **Simple REST API**: A basic Spring Boot application with CRUD functionality.
- **Spring Security**: An application demonstrating security features like authentication and authorization.
- **Spring Data JPA**: A project focusing on data persistence with relational databases.

Feel free to explore each project to see how I have applied the concepts I've learned.

## üå± Learning Journey

As I continue to learn and explore new features of Spring Boot, I plan to add more projects and code examples. This repository will evolve as I gain more experience, and I'll continuously update it with best practices and new technologies.

## üîß How to Run the Projects

To run any project, follow these general steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/spring-boot-learning.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the specific project folder:

   ```bash
   cd path/to/project
   ```

3. Build and run the application:

   For Maven:
   ```bash
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

   For Gradle:
   ``` bash
   ./gradlew bootRun
   ```

Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:8080 (or another port if specified in the application).
